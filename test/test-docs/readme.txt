SETA INDEXER - README

This is a plain text file for testing the document indexer.

The seta-indexer is a command-line utility that creates a vector database
from your documentation files. It supports multiple file formats and
provides semantic search capabilities.

Key benefits:
- Fast semantic search across all your documents
- Incremental indexing (only processes changed files)
- Support for PDF, Markdown, and text files
- Local embeddings (no external API required)
- Built with TypeScript for reliability

Installation:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run npm install
3. Build with npm run build
4. Use node dist/cli.js to run commands
